atari'kids" - centware

created by derik revenge - summer 1998

i created atari kids based upon hiroshima.  
it doesnt have any punction that i remember, or numbers.
there is no kerning because i made the font for myself,
so i just fix myself.

this is centware, if you make money using this font, i
want 1 percent of what you make.  

thanks
